## Implementation

The program consists of a canvas (in the literal sense of the word) and five controls:
- A tool picker
- A color picker
- A save button (to download your masterpiece)
- A load button (to upload an image to the program)
- An undo button (to correct any mistakes)

The tool picker consists of a total of 6 tools:
- A paint tool (imitates freehand painting)
- A floodfill tool (colors all connected pixels of the same color)
- A rectangle tool 
- A pick color tool (this is **NOT** the same as the color picker control)
- A circle tool
- A line drawing tool
